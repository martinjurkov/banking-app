# Banking App

## Intro

Hello, there! üôãüèΩ‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏è

I would like to introduce you to my Banking App.

## Overview

For this challenge, I used...

 - JavaScript (ES6) (to build out the site)
 - SCSS/SASS preprocessor (to style it)

## Challenge
Users should be able to:

### Exchange rates:
 - on the left side to see a table of different exchange rates of currencies comparing to 1 chosen main currency
 - on the right side to be able to calculate optional amount of main currency to another chosen currency
 - informations about exchange rates are updated every 5 - 30 minutes

### Internet Banking:
 - log in up to 3 accounts (1. account - user: mj, pin: 1111; 2. account - user: lm, pin: 2222; 3. account - user: rm, pin: 3333)
 -  on the left side is navbar with 4 items 
 -  My Cards
 -  user is currently in first item - My Cards, where he/she can see current balance of the account and card info
 -  plus on the right side there is a table with all transfers/payments, every transfer has logo or initials of the counterparty, name of the     counterparty, amount of money and date of the transaction
 -  in the bottom left corner is 5 min timer for the safety reasons
 -  Payments
 -  in the second item of navbar user can make a payment to another two accounts
 -  amount of payment is possible up to current balance of the account
 -  payment is after that shown in transaction table on the right side (in sender account and also in the receiver account)
 -  plus current balance of these two accounts are updated
 -  Request loan
 -  in the third item of navbar user can make a request for a loan from bank
 -  loan amount must be up to 25% of the current balance in account - this is the only condition for simplicity
 -  after requesting loan there is 3s timer for evaluation of the loan and after that there is a green stamp (success) or red stamp (failure)
 -  requested amount is shown in the transaction table and current balance is updated
 -  Saving Account
 -  user can send money to saving account, where he/she can receive interests at the end of the year
